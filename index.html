        <h1>This is a mothefucking website.</h1>
        <p>And it's fucking perfect</p>
        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
        <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">that grotesque pile of shit</a> 
            into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so 
            fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across 
                (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>tout le blabla</h2>
        <br/>
        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. 
            What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. 
            Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. 
            You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
